# Password-Generator-Project




This application emphasizes the use of Javascript to generate a random, secure password for the user.

## Getting Started
This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment link.


The user will be prompted to choose from the following password criteria: 8 and 128 characters
The user will recieve a confirm for:
Password containing special characters, numbers, and uppercase
Either 4 variables individual ones, or 3 with toLowerCase to Uppercase conversion
This will need to randomly generate a selection or randomly select array data, so math.random and math.floor will need to be used.
The application should validate user input and ensure that at least one character type is selected.
If, else if statement
Once all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts. Displaying the generated password in an alert is acceptable, but attempt to write the password to the page instead.
Event listener will determine the password output with function to populate the value into the test area.
